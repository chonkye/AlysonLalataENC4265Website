## Checking if The Sims 4 is Installed
1. Press the Windows key on your keyboard or click the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of
your screen.
2. In the search bar, type **The Sims 4**.

Image: Screenshot of the Windows search with “The Sims 4” showing in the results.

4. If the game is installed, you should see “The Sims 4” appear as a desktop app in the search
results.
a. Click Open to launch the game.
b. Alternatively, right-click it and select Open file location to confirm where the game is installed.

If you do not see The Sims 4 in your search results, the game is not currently installed on your device.
