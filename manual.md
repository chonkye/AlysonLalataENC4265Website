# Enabling Mods and Script Mods in Game Options
Before you can use any mods in The Sims 4, including the UI Cheats Extension, you must enable them within the game settings. By default, The Sims 4 disables all mods and script mods after installation or updates. Now that the mod has been installed, follow the steps below to ensure that both custom content and script mods are activated in the game‚Äôs options menu.
1. Launch The Sims 4 app.
   - Press the **Windows** icon on the lower left-hand side of your screen.
   - In the search bar, type *The Sims 4*
   - Select the **Open** option from the menu.
2. Select the **Menu button** in the top right-hand corner of the screen.

<p style="text-align:center;"> FIGURE 15 "SCREENSHOT OF THE LOCATION OF THE 'GAME OPTIONS' BUTTON" (IMAGE BY ALYSON LALATA) </p>
4. Click the Other tab on the left-hand side of the menu.
5. Check both:
- *Enable Custom Content and Mods*
- *Script Mods Allowed*
<p style="text-align:center;"> FIGURE 16 "SCREENSHOT WITH BOTH REQUIRED OPTIONS TURNED ON" (IMAGE BY ALYSON LALATA) </p>
After selecting the ‚ÄúScript Mods Allowed‚Äù box, a warning will popup.

# Mods in The Sims 4 FAQs
## What is a script mod?
A script mod is a type of game modification that uses Python scripts to add or change gameplay functions in The Sims 4. These mods often affect how the game operates, such as automating tasks, altering interactions, or adding new mechanics. Script mods typically use the *.ts4script* file extension and must be placed directly inside the **Mods** folder (not more than one folder deep) to work properly. 

## What is custom content?
Custom content refers to user-created assets such as clothing, hairstyles, furniture, d√©cor, and other visual enhancements that add variety to the game. Unlike script mods, CC usually does not affect game mechanics and instead focuses on aesthetics. These files use the *.package* file extension. 

## Do I have to use mods or custom content to play the game?
No, mods and custom content are entirely optional. You can play The Sims 4 without installing any mods or CC. The game is fully functional on its own. If you do choose to use mods, you can enable or disable them at any time through the in-game settings.

## Are mods official content?
No. Mods and custom content are created by third-party developers and members of the Sims community. They are not developed, supported, or endorsed by *Electronic Arts (EA)* or *Maxis*, the creators of The Sims 4. Use mods at your own discretion and always download them from trusted sources. 

## Can I use this mod with other mods?
Yes, this mod is generally compatible with other mods, except for other UI mods that override the same interface elements. Avoid using multiple mods that change the same part of the interface, as they may conflict with each other. 

## How do I update the mod when a new version is released?
Delete the old version of the mod from your Mods folder, then download and install the new version by following the same steps in this guide. Always download from the official source to avoid broken or malicious files. 

## My mod isn‚Äôt working - what do I do?
First, double-check that both the *.ts4script* and *.package* files are placed directly in the *Mods* folder (not inside any extra subfolders). Also, make sure that you have enabled both "Script Mods Allowed" and "Enable Custom Content and Mods" in the in-game settings under 
*Game Options > Other*. 
After enabling, restart the game.
