# Introduction
The UI Cheats Extension mod enhances gameplay in The Sims 4 by allowing players to activate cheats directly through the game's user interface, eliminating the need to manually enter commands into the cheat console.

With this mod, players can control or modify elements within the following panels:

  <tr><td>Simology Panel</td><td>Buy / Sell Panel</td><td>Sim Stat Panel</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Social Groups Panel</td><td>Owned Businesses Panel</td><td>Create-a-Sim (CAS)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Money Counter / Moodlet Area</td><td>Game Speed Controls / In-Game Clock</td><td>Sim Profile</td></tr>
</table>

This guide covers the full installation process for *UI Cheats Extension v1.47*, which is compatible with The Sims 4 game version 1.113.277. This version of the mod is not compatible with earlier versions of the game.

Note: This mod may only conflict with other UI mods that override the same interface elements. It does not conflict with other types of mods, such as script mods or tuning mods.

# Installing The Sims 4

## Checking if The Sims 4 is Installed
1. Press the **Windows key** on your keyboard or click the **Windows icon** in the bottom-left corner of
your screen.
2. In the search bar, type *The Sims 4*.

Image: Screenshot of the Windows search with The Sims 4 showing in the results.

4. If the game is installed, you should see The Sims 4 appear as a desktop app in the search results.
   - Click **Open** to launch the game.

If you do not see The Sims 4 in your search results, the game is not currently installed on your device.

## Installing The Sims 4
The Sims 4 must be installed through either the EA App or Steam, depending on where you own the
game.

2. Launch the EA App and log in with your EA account.
3. In the Search bar, type *The Sims 4*.
4. If you already own the game, it will show as *Owned*.
5. Click **Install**.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an install location and wait for the game to download and install.

### Installing via Steam
1. Open Steam and log in.
2. Go to your **Library**.
3. Locate *The Sims 4* in your game list.
4. Click **Install** and follow the prompts.
