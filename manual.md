# Extracting the Zip File
Now that you have downloaded the mod, it is time to extract the file so it can be properly installed into The Sims 4. The mod comes in a compressed .zip format, which means its contents need to be

extraction process. 
1. Locate File Explorer
- Press the Windows Icon in the lower left-hand side of your screen.

# Installing the Mod into The Sims 4
Now that the file has been extracted, it is time to move the mod to the proper folder so that The Sims 4 can recognize and load it. Simply downloading and extracting the mod is not enough‚Äîthe game requires that mods be placed in a specific directory inside the user‚Äôs Documents folder. The following steps will guide you through locating the extracted files and moving them into the correct Mods folder for proper installation. 

## Locate the Extracted Mod Folder
1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Navigate to the **Downloads** Folder
3. Locate the folder named *UI_Cheats_Extension_v1.47* next to the original *.zip* file.
4. Double-click the folder to open it.
5. Inside, confirm that it contains two files:
- *UI_Cheats_Extension.ts4script*
- *UI_Cheats_Extension.package* 

## Open The Sims 4 Mods Directory
1. Open a new **File Explorer** window:
- Right-click the **File Explorer** icon on your taskbar.
- Click **File Explorer** to launch a second window.
2. In the new window, navigate to the following location:
   *Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4 > Mods*

## Move the Mod Files
1. In the original **File Explorer** window (**Downloads** folder), select the *UI_Cheats_Extension_v1.47* folder.
2. Drag and drop the entire folder into the **Mods** folder located inside **The Sims 4** directory. 

Tip: The folder should not be nested more than one level deep. For best results, place the folder directly in the Mods folder, not inside another subfolder. 

## Verify Mod Files
1. Double-click the *UI_Cheats_Extension_v1.47* folder now inside the **Mods** directory.
2. Confirm that both of the following files are present:
   a. *UI_Cheats_Extension.ts4script* and *UI_Cheats_Extension.package*

# Mods in The Sims 4 FAQs
## What is a script mod?
A script mod is a type of game modification that uses Python scripts to add or change gameplay functions in The Sims 4. These mods often affect how the game operates, such as automating tasks, altering interactions, or adding new mechanics. Script mods typically use the *.ts4script* file extension and must be placed directly inside the Mods folder (not more than one folder deep) to work properly. 

## What is custom content?
Custom content refers to user-created assets such as clothing, hairstyles, furniture, d√©cor, and other visual enhancements that add variety to the game. Unlike script mods, CC usually does not affect game mechanics and instead focuses on aesthetics. These files use the *.package* file extension. 

## Do I have to use mods or custom content to play the game?
No, mods and custom content are entirely optional. You can play The Sims 4 without installing any mods or CC. The game is fully functional on its own. If you do choose to use mods, you can enable or disable them at any time through the in-game settings.

## Are mods official content?
No. Mods and custom content are created by third-party developers and members of the Sims community. They are not developed, supported, or endorsed by Electronic Arts (EA) or Maxis, the creators of The Sims 4. Use mods at your own discretion and always download them from trusted sources. 

## Can I use this mod with other mods?
Yes, this mod is generally compatible with other mods, except for other UI mods that override the same interface elements. Avoid using multiple mods that change the same part of the interface, as they may conflict with each other. 

## How do I update the mod when a new version is released?
Delete the old version of the mod from your Mods folder, then download and install the new version by following the same steps in this guide. Always download from the official source to avoid broken or malicious files. 

## My mod isn‚Äôt working - what do I do?
First, double-check that both the *.ts4script* and *.package* files are placed directly in the Mods folder (not inside any extra subfolders). Also, make sure that you have enabled both "Script Mods Allowed" and "Enable Custom Content and Mods" in the in-game settings under 
*Game Options > Other*. 
After enabling, restart the game.
