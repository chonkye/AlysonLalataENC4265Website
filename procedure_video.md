# Procedure Video
## Reason for the Assignment
People often need help with a specific procedure that is especially complicated or difficult to explain in static text and images. Enter: video. 
The procedure video explains how to do one specific thing and is short and to the point. It does not need to include the "why" of each step (like a tutorial does). This is simply how to do one thing.
