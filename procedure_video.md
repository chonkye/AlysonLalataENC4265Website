# Procedure Video
## Reason for the Assignment
People often need help with a specific procedure that is especially complicated or difficult to explain in static text and images. Enter: video. 
The procedure video explains how to do one specific thing and is short and to the point. It does not need to include the "why" of each step (like a tutorial does). This is simply how to do one thing.

In this video, I walk through the process of configuring VLANs on a Cisco switch using Packet Tracer. This tutorial covers setting up a basic network topology, creating VLANs, assigning ports, configuring IP addresses, and verifying network connectivity.

- Setting up a network topology with a Cisco 3560 switch and multiple PCs
- Creating VLANs for different departments (Sales and HR)
- Assigning switch ports to VLANs to segment traffic
- Configuring static IP addresses for each PC within their VLAN subnets
- Verifying VLAN configuration using CLI commands
- Testing network connectivity with the ping command

By the end of this video, you’ll understand how to properly configure VLANs in Packet Tracer, ensuring improved network segmentation and security.
