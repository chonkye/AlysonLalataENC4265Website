Using the Wayback Machine, I analyzed the Target website from January 12, 1998, and
compared it to the website as of January 21, 2025. Over this 27-year span, the differences in
website composition and functionality are striking.

The current Target website is vibrant and highly visual, tailored to the upcoming Valentine’s Day
holiday. It prominently features large, colorful images and banners encouraging shoppers to
view Target as their “one-stop shop” for Valentine’s Day. Scrolling down the homepage reveals
sections for trending items, New Year wellness products, Super Bowl essentials, current
discounts, décor, Lunar New Year items, and featured categories. The homepage is extensive,
packed with content designed to grab attention and encourage interaction.
In contrast, the 1998 Target website has a simple, minimal layout. The homepage features a
single large box in the center, divided into smaller sections promoting various services like the
Washington Monument Restoration donation, the wedding gift registry, the Lullaby Club or baby
gift registry, the Target credit card, guest services, and school uniforms. There’s no mention of
Valentine’s Day or any seasonal promotions on the homepage. Even when exploring other links
on the site, I found no dedicated page for seasonal items, which surprised me given the
proximity to the holiday.

Another notable difference is the 1998 website’s lack of color and visual appeal. While there
were some photos, most pages were dominated by text-heavy descriptions. For instance,
selecting &quot;school uniforms&quot; from the homepage led to a page advocating for the benefits of
wearing and purchasing school uniforms. It even included a statement about how uniforms
could prevent children from being “approached by gangs” due to a lack of “gang colors or attire.”
The amount of text on this page starkly contrasts with the minimal, concise descriptions on the
modern website.

The 2025 Target website is much more user-friendly, featuring intuitive navigation with drop-
down menus and prominent, engaging calls to action. Phrases like “From $5,” “Find cute
Valentine’s Day looks everyone will love,” and “All the top deals in one place” are designed to
attract attention and encourage interaction. This focus on engagement is a standard practice
across modern websites, and it was jarring to see how bare and unappealing the 1998 website
felt in comparison.

Additionally, using the 1998 website was noticeably less convenient. Without drop-down menus
or an easily accessible navigation system, I had to repeatedly use the browser’s back button to
return to previous pages. The old website seemed primarily functional, serving as a tool for
checking if a specific item was available; While the current website feels like an expansive
digital storefront, showcasing everything the business has to offer.
Even when looking at the Target website from January 2005, I found that it still lacked the color,
visual appeal, and promotional content seen on the 2025 site. The evolution of the Target
website reflects broader changes in web design and user expectations, emphasizing ease of
use, visual appeal, and interactivity in modern internet experiences.
