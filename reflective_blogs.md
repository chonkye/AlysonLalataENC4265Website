Using the Wayback Machine, I analyzed the Target website from January 12, 1998, and compared it to the website as of January 21, 2025. Over this 27-year span, the differences in website composition, layout, and functionality were striking, shedding light on how website norms have evolved and how these changes shape the user experience.

### Surprising and Out-of-the-Ordinary Elements
The 1998 Target website featured minimalism and unexpected links to pages of text. The homepage displayed a box divided into smaller sections, advertising the Washington Monument Restoration donation, the Lullaby Club (a baby gift registry), and school uniforms (see fig. 1.1). The promotion for school uniforms to prevent children from being "approached by gangs" stood out as unconventional and out of pleace compared to modern product-focused websites, where companies often avoid publicizing beliefs that might deter potential customers.

Another surprising aspect was the lack of seasonal or promotional content. Despite the proximity to Valentine’s Day, the 1998 site did not feature any related promotions or imagery. This absence of such timely, engaging content felt like a missed opportunity when compared to the modern Target site, which prominently features holiday themes and tailored shopping sections.

### Expected Website Norms and Modern Standards
Modern websites prioritize visual appeal, interactivity, and intuitive navigation. The 2025 Target website utilizes these standards with vibrant visuals, drop-down menus, and calls to action such as “Find cute Valentine’s Day looks everyone will love” (see fig. 1.2) or “All the top deals in one place.” Features like trending items, discounts, and Lunar New Year categories showcase a focus on personalization and engagement.

These features stand in stark contrast to the 1998 Target site, which lacked intuitive navigation tools and relied on text-heavy descriptions with minimal visual appeal. Its static design and limited functionality made it feel more like a basic tool than an engaging digital store. The bottom menu provided few paths to other sections and lacked the flexibility of modern navigation systems.

### The Experience of Visiting an Old Version of the Target Website
![Target Uniform Page on January 12, 1998](target.01121998.uniform.png)
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1.3 - "Target Uniform Page on January 12, 1998." https://web.archive.org/web/19980112113217/http://www.target.com/TargetWWW/schooluniforms/index.html/. Accessed 21 Jan. 25.</p>
As a modern internet user, I had difficulty using visiting the 1998 Target website. As seen in figure 1.3, the lack of any drop-down menus or a cohesive navigation system made it unpleasant to explore, requiring me to rely on the browser’s back button to move between pages. This clunky navigation sharply contrasts with the effortless experience of scrolling and clicking through the 2025 site.

The outdated design also felt visually uninviting. The outdated design was visually bland, with limited use of color, imagery, and fonts. While the modern Target site is designed to encourage prolonged browsing and impulse purchases, the 1998 site seemed solely focused on selling items people were specifically looking for and not trying to rope them into buying more.

### Broader Reflections on Web Design Evolution
The evolution of the Target website mirrors broader trends in web design and technology. I feel that back then, any type of website would have sufficed because there was not such rigor competition for consumers’ attention. Today, faster connections, mobile accessibility, and the rise of online shopping have made rich visuals, interactivity, and personalization the standard.

This assignment highlighted just how much our expectations for websites have changed. Elements like drop-down menus, personalized recommendations, and seasonal promotions is so common that their absence feels unnatural. Visiting the 1998 Target site was a stark reminder of how far web design has come and how integral modern norms are to creating an engaging user experience.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
Changes in technology can cause disruptive changes across many industries! On the job in the computer industry, it is likely that you will be asked to complete quick-start guides, tutorials, instructional videos, and manuals in a very short amount of time. Other careers may also require these skills, and given how many of us rely on computers in our daily lives, the updates that are constantly being pushed out, unfortunately, sometimes seem to take the approach of "update now, explain the update to users later" (anybody remember Windows 8Links to an external site.?).

You need to be able to quickly figure out a platform on your own, and then clearly explain how to use it in writing, image, or video (or a combination of these).

## Assignment Rationale: Prompt C
Ask a generative AI tool (maybe one in Boodlebox or Copilot) to generate something you might have to write in your future career. Assess the result, and then revise your prompt or "stack" an additional prompt onto it (e.g., "remove the passive voice and add headings"). Congratulations, you're a prompt engineer now. Add this skill to your resume. On your website, post: 1) your original and revised prompts 2) your assessment of what it generated 3) (optional) what it generated.

## Orginal Prompt
“can you write a status report for an on project on a 2d platformer game. Hypothetically it would be in the Production phase, doing character design.”

## Revised Prompt:
"looking back on the first report you generated, can you adjust the report so it’s in the style of a weekly status report. Can you keep it concise and use technical writing?”

---
## Assesment and reflection on what was generated 
I was pleasantly surprised on what Microsoft Copilot was able to generate. First I researched what the proper components of a Status report is, and then crafted the prompt that I wanted the AI to use. I am already familiar with the phases and processes of creating a 2D platformer game, so I thought it was best that I used this as the subject of the report. 

<p align="center">
  <img src= "StatusReport1.png" alt = "Copilot's First Generated Status Report">
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1.1 - Screenshot by Alyson Lalata. "Copilot's First Generated Status Report" https://copilot.microsoft.com/. Accessed 10 Feb. 25.</p>

The first report was highly detailed but felt overly wordy. It seemed to be written for an audience with little to no prior knowledge of the project, I didn’t specify on the type of status report (daily, weekly, monthly, internal or external) so I understood as to why the report had so much information. It effectively covered key aspects of game production, highlighting both challenges and achievements. The Progress Overview section provided an in-depth breakdown of different character design aspects. The achievements and challenges were clearly outlined, along with specific actions needed to move the project forward. 

<p align="center">
  <img src= "StatusReport2.png" alt = "Copilot's Second Generated Status Report">
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1.2 - Screenshot by Alyson Lalata. "Copilot's Second Generated Status Report" https://copilot.microsoft.com/. Accessed 10 Feb. 25.</p>

In contrast, the second report was much more concise. It didn’t elaborate on every detail encountered, making it more effective for quickly informing the team about that week’s progress without being overly long or difficult to read. This version appeared to be tailored for an internal audience already familiar with the project, unlike the original report. The Progress Overview was able to summarize each aspect of character design, briefly mentioned key accomplishments for the week, and included a short description of the main issues faced.

Despite these differences, both reports maintained the same structure and headings, consistently providing status updates on each stage of the process (e.g., “Completed,” “70% complete”). 

One limitation I noticed was the AI’s tendency to generalize. While the structure of the reports was consistent, I found that I would need to specify areas of the prompt to align with the actual progress of the project. If I were to generate another status report, I would write my prompt so that it specifies which details to emphasize and how much explanation is needed. But with all said, I still think it would be better to write out the status report oneself and then have an AI tool compress it so that it is more concise and will know all the information that you want in the report than taking its own liberties.

Through this exercise, I gained insight into both the capabilities and limitations of AI in technical writing. While Microsoft Copilot can generate structured and informative reports, the human touch remains crucial in refining the content for fact-checking, tone, and readability.

The Manual Assessment Memo was a challenging but insightful assignment. I chose a printer manual because of its common usability frustrations. While the manual avoided redundancy, I found that it lacked clarity in some areas, making troubleshooting difficult. 

One of my main challenges was ensuring my critique was constructive rather than nitpicking. I initially wrote too much, reducing the readability and conciseness expected in a memo. To refine my response, I used ChatGPT-4 to identify redundant sections while ensuring my critique remained focused.

This assignment reminded me that technical writing must be concise, and not everything needs a detailed explanation. Based on Dr. Johnson’s feedback, I would ensure that links are clickable and eliminate unnecessary descriptors that slow the reader down. In future assignments, I will be more intentional about keeping my writing skimmable and concise while maintaining precision.

## Assignment Rationale 
Prompt E: Analyze a chatbot (e.g., customer service, virtual assistant). Spend at least 5 minutes interacting with it & exploring its functionality. Then, reflect on the bot's: purpose (What is the chatbot designed to do?, functionality (how well does it perform its tasks?), user experience (was it easy to use? What were the strengths and weaknesses?), and context (how does it benefit users and the organization?)

GPT-Travel is a chatbot designed to assist tourists by suggesting destinations, activities, and general travel advice. However, my first experience with it was frustrating due to its limitations. I was expecting the cite to help me find hotels, events happening around the location I was planning to travel and more. Unfortunately the chatbot was unable to browse the internet, and instead directed me to other websites that could possiblely help.

<p align="center">

</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1.1 - Screenshot by Alyson Lalata. "GPT-Travel Tries to Find Cheapest Hotel" https://poe.com/GPT-Travel. Accessed 3 Mar.</p>

GPT-Travel is useful for generating broad travel ideas and providing general estimates, but it lacks real-time information gathering, contextual memory, and precise budgeting tools. The cite itself is pleasant to look at, similar to many other AI tools with a dark background with white text. The chatbot is easy to use and responds quickly, but its inability to retain context and reliance on pre-existing knowledge limit its effectiveness. While structured queries improve its responses, users must be very specific to get relevant answers.

</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1.2 - Screenshot by Alyson Lalata. "GPT-Travel Compares Vacation" https://poe.com/GPT-Travel. Accessed 3 Mar.</p>

GPT-Travel is best suited as an initial trip-planning tool rather than a full-fledged travel assistant. The chatbot gives users general ideas, common tourist spots/ activities while using descriptive diction to paint each location in a positive light. It can help users brainstorm destinations and activities, but it can not replace real-time travel research. The chatbot was also able to successfully compare two different types of travel vacations when given details about the party going (Figure 1.2). Additionally, retaining memory from pervious inquiries would provide a smoother chatting experience so users do not have to repeat themselves. The chatbot however worked better when being very specific in the inquires entered, but it took away from the ease of use of the experience, making it less intuitive.

While GPT-Travel can offer general travel suggestions and comparisons, its lack of real-time data and contextual awareness limit its practicality. It is best used for brainstorming rather than detailed trip planning, and users must carefully structure their inquiries to get the most relevant results.

## Strengths of GPT-Travel
GPT-Travel performs well in generating general travel recommendations. It effectively suggests destinations, activities, and vacation comparisons based on user input. Additionally, the interface is user-friendly, and responses are generated quickly, enhancing accessibility.

## Limitations and Required Modifications
Despite its strengths, GPT-Travel has notable limitations. First being that there was a lack of real-time data. The chatbot cannot retrieve up-to-date information on hotel prices, events, or travel deals. Instead, it redirects users to external websites, reducing its effectiveness as a comprehensive planning tool. There was also limited context retention, where GPT-Travel did not maintain memory across interactions. As a result, I had to re-enter details when refining their queries, leading to inefficiencies in the interaction process. Finally there was a dependency on structured queries. The chatbot performed better when given specific and structured queries. This reduced the intuitiveness of the experience, as users must refine and rephrase their inputs multiple times to obtain relevant information.

## AI Training Data and Constraints
GPT-Travel’s responses suggest that its training data consists of static travel guides, pre-existing articles, and general travel knowledge rather than dynamic, real-time sources. The dataset likely includes information on popular tourist destinations and broad budgeting estimates but excludes real-time travel updates, localized events, and dynamic pricing. 

## Future Implications
Advancements in AI technology may enhance chatbot functionality with the integration of real-time data; where the AI can access live travel databases, providing current hotel rates, flight availability, and event schedules. Improved Context Awareness for enhanced memory capabilities could enable AI to retain previous interactions, reducing the need for repeated user input.
While GPT-Travel is a useful tool for initial trip planning, its limitations highlight the necessity of human input and supplementary research. As AI continues to evolve, it may transition from a brainstorming assistant to a fully functional travel planning system with real-time capabilities.

Something that I got critiqued on was how I numbered my manual, the AI also numbered the heading which is not how it’s supposed to be. The guide uses items that are readily available in most households, making it accessible for a wide audience. But the captions provided were not that descriptive as to what should be in the picture and were not formatted properly. There were spots where I am to insert visuals to help enhance the guide and meet the assignment requirements. I found the diction and tone used to match the professional and instructional feel that the assignment calls for. There was consistency issues on the wordage used to describe certain items. For example, the term “mild soap” and “baby soap” are used interchangeably, but the guide should only refer to a product using the same term throughout to not confuse the reader. I think the guide could also use bullet points or bolding key terms within each step to make the guide even more skimmable. At the end of the guide there are helpful tips so that the user doesn’t damage their leather item.
